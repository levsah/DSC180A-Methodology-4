## Quarter 2 Brainstorm Prompts

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
One of the most engaging topics this quarter has been the intersection of wearable technology and data-driven health analytics. I found it particularly fascinating how sensor-based time series data, when properly preprocessed and labeled, can uncover underlying behavioral patterns that often go unnoticed in traditional medical assessments. The balance between quantitative modeling and qualitative interpretation makes this area both technically challenging and intellectually rewarding.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
The application of a Classification Model is one avenue that I'd like to bring into life for this research effort. I'm fairly confident that given features such as behavioral tendencies and physiological signals, we can use that data to minimize the gap between the self-reported stress levels in patients and how their actual stress levels are evaluated and determined on wearable digital devices.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
If given the opportunity to refine my current project, I would focus on implementing a more robust validation framework for model evaluation. Specifically, I would shift from a simple random train-test split to a stratified cross-validation approach to ensure better generalization across participant groups. This adjustment would not only reduce bias but also strengthen the interpretability of the final performance metrics, particularly when comparing across multiple stress-related datasets.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’m interested in exploring the integration of ensemble learning and temporal feature extraction methods for this project. Techniques such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and sliding window feature engineering could provide deeper insight into dynamic stress transitions over time. Additionally, applying dimensionality reduction methods like PCA or t-SNE could help visualize complex relationships between physiological and psychological variables more intuitively.
